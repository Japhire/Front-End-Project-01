<h1>Homelessness</h1>
<p> Homelessness in the United States refers to the issue of homelessness, a condition wherein 
    people lack "a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence" as defined by 
    The McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act. Point-in-time single night counts prepared
     by shelter providers differ greatly from federal government accounts. In 2014, approximately 1.5 million sheltered homeless
     people were counted.The federal government statistics are prepared by the United States 
     Department of Housing and Urban Development's Annual Homeless Assessment Report; 
     as of 2018, HUD reported there were roughly 553,000 homeless people in the United States 
     on a given night,or 0.17% of the population. Annual federal HUD reports contradict private state 
    and local reports where homelessnessis shown to have increased each year since 201 across several major American cities, with 40 
     percent increases noted in 2017 and in 2019.In January of 2018 the federal government 
     statistics gave comprehensive encompassing nationwide statistics, with a total number of
      552,830 individuals, of which 358,363 (65%) were sheltered in provided housing, while
     some 194,467 (35%) were unsheltered.</p>
    <p> There is an urgent need for the government to overhaul its approach to homelessness. 
        Even before the coronavirus pandemic, millions of American families struggled to afford a 
        safe place to live — a housing crisis driven primarily by soaring prices in major 
        metropolitan areas. The pandemic has made a bad situation that much worse. The clear 
        goal of federal policy ought to be the minimization of homelessness. The first step is
         for the federal government to get its arms around the problem. It should require every
          community that receives federal funding for programs intended to help the homeless
           to emulate Kern County and a growing number of other cities and counties that 
           track people who are homeless, by name, throughout the year. Local governments,
         of course, needn’t wait for federal prodding to get started.</p>
         <p> The counting process also is less precise than might be implied by the resulting federal 
            report that put the number of homeless Americans at exactly 567,715. Cities generally rely 
            on volunteers, and larger cities often sample rather than attempt a comprehensive count. 
            New York, for example, divides the city into 7,000 zones, and then actually tries to count
             the number of homeless people in 1,500 of those zones. Advocacy groups have highlighted
            long lists of blind spots, including people who are in hospitals on the night of the 
            count and therefore not tallied. In recent years, New York has paid people to pretend
            to be homeless, to check the accuracy of its survey teams. There’s good reason to 
            worry: A 2008 study that tested the technique found that the counters missed 29
            percent of the “homeless” actors. But most cities don’t impose similar quality
             controls and submit what amounts to an estimate. </p>
